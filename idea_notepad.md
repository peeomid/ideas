# Idea Notepad

## Quick Ideas
- Like this ideas repo -> Need sth to manage projects/todo centrally, that I can:
    - Add to all projects, then update projects
    - Can ask progress update
    -> What if I have a remote mcp server to handle this? Then I can ask normal claude for updates
    To store todo, can use Notion db, or a custom db?

## Quick Todos
*(Ideas and tasks that come up randomly - process these weekly into proper project todos)*

- [ ] Example: Random task that came up
- [ ] Example: Idea to investigate later  
- [ ] Example: Thing to add to proper project todo

## Processing Notes
- Review this section every Monday during weekly planning
- Move todos to appropriate project `todo.md` files
- Archive completed quick todos
- Keep this section clean and focused on current captures
