_Tens of thousands_ of people have already made the switch from Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook, and other email + calendar services.

> Just got a demo of HEY with [@jasonfried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried). ❤️ **The level of product thinking** that’s gone into rebuilding email from scratch.   [![Ryan Hoover Twitter](/assets/images/home/avatar-rh.png)Ryan Hoover](https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1260298216811032577)

> In positive news, HEY seems to have finally solved email (!!!). Been using it several weeks and **no longer dealing with spam, long lists of “unread” messages, or sorting out annoying but important docs.** The relief is so real. 🙌   [![Darya Rose Twitter](/assets/images/home/avatar-dr.png)Darya Rose](https://twitter.com/summertomato/status/1270816132102930433)

> **HEY is the most exciting app I’ve used in years.** A complete rethinking of email, full of bold, brilliant ideas. Highly recommended. Not only for the product itself, but because its boldness will inspire you to question your assumptions and think differently.

> Gmail and virtually all of its competitors assume anyone should be able to email you and then you should store and sort and search and categorize those messages. **HEY assumes that only the people you want email from should be able to email you.**   [![Ezra Klein NYT Op-Ed](/assets/images/home/avatar-ek.png)Ezra Klein](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/07/opinion/gmail-email-digital-shame.html)

> **If you designed email from scratch such that it vigorously protected your privacy and your time, this is what it would look like.** I think you’re going to love it. 🏆   [![Mike Davidson Twitter](/assets/images/home/avatar-md.png)Mike Davidson](https://twitter.com/mikeindustries/status/1252656956591898624)

> **HEY is a game changer for email and owning your time.** A big part of my work is diving into new teams and email gets flooded quickly. [@jasonfried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried), [@dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh) and their team are changing the foundation for my work and it’s amazing.

> I just got an early demo of HEY from [@jasonfried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried). I can confirm this will be my new default email over Gmail… **it’s a beautiful rethinking of everything wrong with email.** I can’t wait for you all to play with it soon.

> Happy to say that HEY is every bit as clever as I expected, **a radical rethinking of email and dramatically better in a dozen ways.** (And because it’s by the [@basecamp](https://twitter.com/basecamp) team, I know it won’t get swallowed up by BigTechCo a month after launch.)

**There’s plenty more where those came from** — keep reading the [nice things people are saying](/testimonials/) about HEY.

* * *

### Screen emails like you screen your calls

The first time someone emails you they land in **The Screener**. You decide if you want to hear from them or not. **Yes** and they’re in, **No** and you’ll never hear from them again. You’re in control.

   ![The Screener](/assets/images/home/the-screener.png)

### The Imbox is for your important email

When you say “Yes”, their email lands in the **Imbox** by default. It’s the place for emails you actually want to read, from **im**portant people and services you absolutely want to hear from.

### A Paper Trail for receipts and transactions

Keep transactional email clutter in one place, out of your face. When you need to refer to a receipt, order confirmation, service notification, etc. just head over to the **Paper Trail**.

### The Feed is for your casual, whenever reads

**The Feed** turns newsletters and long-reads into a browsable, casual newsfeed. Just scroll, everything’s open already. See something you like? Click it and read the whole thing right in place.

### Calendaring sucked for years, we fixed it

Digital calendars have barely evolved for decades. Our all-new [Calendar](/calendar/) is a modern, breath-of-fresh-air take on calendaring.

### And there’s so much more

When you put it all together — power over who gets through to you, purpose-built boxes for the different flavors of emails, dedicated workflows, strong privacy protections, and an innovative, integrated calendar — _it’s like magic_.

Hey everyone—

I’m Jason, CEO here at 37signals.

Email gets a bad rap, but it shouldn’t. Email’s a treasure.

It feels great to get an email from someone you care about. Or a newsletter you enjoy. Or an update from a service you like. That’s how email used to feel all the time.

But things changed.

You started getting stuff you didn’t want from people you didn’t know. You lost control over who could reach you. An avalanche of automated emails cluttered everything up.

And Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and Apple just let it happen.

Now email feels like a chore, rather than a joy. Something you fall behind on. Something you clear out, not cherish. Rather than delight in it, you deal with it.

And yet, email remains a wonder. Thanks to email, people across cultures, continents, countries, cities, and communities communicate every day. It’s reliable. It’s simple. It makes it easy for two humans to share their love, and for millions of people to earn a living.

So good news, the magic’s still there. It’s just obscured — buried under a mess of bad habits and neglect. Some from people, some from machines, a lot from email software.

Email deserves a dust off. A renovation. Modernized for the way we email today.

With HEY, we’ve done just that. It’s a redo, a rethink, a simplified, potent reintroduction of email. A fresh start, the way it should be.

HEY is our love letter to email and calendars, and we’re sending it to you on the Web, Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android.

Jason Fried

Co-founder & CEO
