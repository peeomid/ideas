### SaneBox is a life saver for every professional.

Before SaneBox I spent literally hours per day on sorting and treating the hundreds of emails that I receive everyday. Now SaneBox has done the work for me BEFORE I open my box. I can quickly scan what is important - put to later what needs reading - and focus on my priorities. SaneBox saves me at least 2 to 3 hours work per day.

### I couldn't live without SaneBox.

It saves me time. But more importantly, it helps ensure that I don't drop the ball with anything I need to do. I just set it to send me a reminder on a specific date.

### Buying back time made easy

SaneBox has been instrumental to getting my time back (and my sanity). I have easily been able to save more than 7 hours a week because of its effectiveness. I recommend it to anyone that has to deal with the chaos of e-mail.

Eric S.

### 1000% worth the annual subscription

SaneBox makes email sooo much more efficient. I especially love the feature that reminds me when to follow-up with someone. My emails are always neatly organized too.

### My email was causing me insanity before SaneBox

SaneBox keeps my email box sane. I still get hundreds of emails but I really only have to look at the ones that are for me. Plus, it does a really good job of learning what is important to me.

Brain R

### By far an investment that pays of in ways most unexpected

It is deceptively simply to use and well - sure it saves time - tons of it. Though the biggest benefit to this services is in the unknown ways it brings with it a very certain peace, a genuine realignment with sanity; no longer am I avoiding my inbox because I felt like it controlled me.

### Out of sight, out of mind

Sometimes important emails should wait. **Snooze** sends emails away until you’re ready for them. Like on Monday morning, instead of Saturday night.

We also offer a 14-day free trial for each plan, allowing you to test out the service before committing. We’re pretty sure after 2 weeks, you’ll never know how you managed without us 😉. Additionally, educational, non-profit, and government agencies can get a 25% discount on any plan.
