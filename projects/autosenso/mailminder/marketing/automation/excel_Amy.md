I have to regularly do following task:

- I have one excel file exported from a software, with item code, and quality. Let's say this is file A1

- I have another file from a restaurant with the same information, item code and quality. Let's say this is file B1. In this file, I have multiple tab, each tab is the numbers of a day in month.

What I need to do, is to check, using matched item code, to see if number in B1 matches with A1.

What I normally do, is to open B1 file, go to each tab, then do vlookup for all items in the tab to get quality from A1, then add another column to minus that lookuped values, to see if where's the differences between 2 files.

Then for each month, there're roughly 30 tabs, and I have to do that 30 times. That takes time. Suggest a way to make it faster
