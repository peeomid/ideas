## Does Your Inbox Feel Like This?

Email shouldn't control your workday. Yet most of us face these challenges:

- üòì **Important emails get buried** in a flood of newsletters and updates
- üîÑ **Hours wasted sorting emails** that could be spent on actual work
- üòü **Living with inbox anxiety**, afraid of missing crucial messages

Your inbox should work for you, not against you.


## How MailMinder Works

### Here's how MailMinder works
### Organize your inbox in 3 simple steps

MailMinder screens new senders and learns your preferences to keep your inbox clean. **No complex rules to set up.** Just tell us where emails belong, and **we'll handle the rest automatically.**

1. **New Emails Go to Screening**
   - All emails from new senders go to a special screening area first, keeping your inbox clean.

2. **Choose Where Emails Belong**
   - Pick a category for screened emails: Imbox for important stuff, Feed for newsletters, Papertrail for records, or Promotional for marketing.

3. **Let MailMinder Handle the Rest**
   - Future emails from those senders automatically go to the right place. Your inbox stays clean with only important messages.
