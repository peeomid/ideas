## How MailMinder Works

1. **Quick Setup:** Install MailMinder in your Google account (takes 2 minutes)
2. **First Sort:** New emails go to a screening category
3. **Train Once:** Pick a category for each sender
4. **Relax:** MailMinder sorts both existing and future emails automatically
5. **Enjoy:** Your inbox stays organized without lifting a finger

### Smart Categories That Make Sense

- 📥 **Imbox - Important Messages**
  Messages you need to see right away: client emails, team communications, family messages. These stay in focus.

- 📰 **Feed - Read Later**
  Newsletters, blog updates, and other non-urgent reads. Check them when you have time, without cluttering your main inbox.

- 📋 **Papertrail - Keep for Reference**
  Receipts, bills, and statements automatically filed away. Easy to find when needed, but not in your way.

- 🎯 **Promotional - Deals & Updates**
  Sales, offers, and product updates in one place. Browse when you want, ignore when busy.

MailMinder learns which emails go where based on your choices. Sort an email once, and all future emails from that sender automatically go to the right place.
