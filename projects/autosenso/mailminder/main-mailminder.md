# MailMinder - Gmail Filter Management & Email Organization

## Problem
Email overload affects productivity with 100+ daily emails causing anxiety, important messages getting lost, and manual organization consuming 30+ minutes daily. Current Gmail tools don't work on mobile and lack intelligent automation.

## Solution
MailMinder transforms Gmail into an organized, intelligent email system using HEY.com's proven workflow design. It automatically screens new emails and learns from your categorization preferences to create Gmail filters and sort future emails.

## Current Status
**Existing project with comprehensive documentation** - Ready for production refinement
