# AutoSenso (MailMinder) - Detailed Project Introduction

## Overview

AutoSenso is a Gmail automation tool that transforms email overload into organized productivity. Inspired by HEY.com's revolutionary email workflow, AutoSenso brings intelligent email categorization to your existing Gmail account without requiring you to abandon your current email address or migrate to a new service.

## The Problem

Modern email users face overwhelming inbox chaos:
- **Email Overload**: Receiving 100+ emails daily creates anxiety and stress
- **Important Messages Lost**: Critical emails get buried in promotional content and newsletters
- **Manual Organization is Time-Consuming**: Sorting emails manually takes 30+ minutes daily
- **Vacation Email Nightmare**: Returning from time off means facing hundreds of unorganized messages
- **Mobile App Limitations**: Gmail extensions only work on web, not mobile apps

## The Solution

AutoSenso implements an intelligent email screening and categorization system that:

### 1. **Automatic Email Screening**
- All emails from new senders go to a "screening" area first
- Your inbox stays clean while you decide where emails belong
- No important messages get lost in the clutter

### 2. **Smart Categorization System**
Based on HEY.com's proven categories:
- **Imbox**: Important emails that deserve immediate attention
- **Feed**: Newsletters, updates, and content you want to read later
- **Papertrail**: Receipts, confirmations, and records you need to keep
- **Promotional**: Marketing emails and offers you might want to review
- **Ignore**: Unwanted emails that go straight to trash

### 3. **Learning-Based Automation**
- When you categorize an email, AutoSenso learns your preference
- Automatically creates Gmail filters for future emails from that sender
- Sorts both existing and future emails from the same sender
- Continuously improves organization based on your choices

## How It Works

### Technical Implementation
AutoSenso is built as a Google Apps Script that:
- Runs entirely within your Google account (no external services)
- Uses Google Sheets to store sender lists and preferences
- Creates and manages Gmail filters automatically
- Operates on Google's infrastructure (no servers to maintain)

### User Experience
1. **Setup**: Run the initialization script once to create labels and sheets
2. **Screening**: New emails from unknown senders get the "to-screen" label
3. **Categorization**: You add emails to appropriate categories using labels
4. **Automation**: AutoSenso creates filters and sorts future emails automatically
5. **Maintenance**: The system runs every 10 minutes to process new emails
