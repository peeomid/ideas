**Things Project**: TheGameHasChanged (Work area)

**Status**: Planning
**Parent Project**: [[projects/trochoinhom/main-trochoinhom]] (Vietnamese version)

## Problem
English-speaking markets (US, UK, etc.) lack a modern, accessible platform for social party games like "Who is the Spy?" and other group games that can be played remotely or in person.

## Target Market
- **Primary**: United States
- **Secondary**: UK, Canada, Australia, English-speaking international
- **Audience**: Friend groups, remote teams, party hosts, team building facilitators

## Solution
English-first online platform for group games, adapted from trochoinhom.com for Western markets with cultural localization and US-focused marketing.

## MVP Features (Single Device Focus)
- "Who is the Spy?" game implementation (client-side only)
- Single device shared screen mode
- English-optimized UI/UX
- Game state management (local only)
- Future-proof structure for additional games
- US-friendly branding and design

## Localization Considerations
- Word categories relevant to US culture
- US English spelling and terminology
- Western design aesthetics
- Pricing in USD (if applicable)
- US-focused marketing channels (Reddit, Discord, etc.)

## Tech Stack
- Astro framework for static site generation
- Client-side JavaScript for game logic
- No backend required for MVP
