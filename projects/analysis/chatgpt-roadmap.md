Perfect — thanks for clarifying. Let’s build a **full 12–18 month roadmap** including **all tools we listed earlier**, structured in **phases → sprints**. Each sprint will follow the format you like (goals, validation tasks, dependencies, outputs). At the end, I’ll add a **Gantt-style timeline chart** so you can visualize overlaps and dependencies.

✅ **Dependencies:**

* Textua/Devsgen → traffic & funnel, required for SaaS launch.
* AutoSenso → first SaaS (funds others).
* Docs→Web → natural upsell from Textua.
* Trochoinhom → traffic injection when SaaS base exists.
* VN plays → best launched once you have brand/domain authority.
* Niche/experimental tools → optional, after main products are stable.

---

✅ This way, you always have **1 business tool + 1 traffic tool in flight**, compounding both revenue and funnel.
✅ Dependencies mapped (AutoSenso needs traffic funnel first, Docs→Web after funnel, Trochoinhom after stable SaaS, etc.).

Would you like me to **also layer revenue vs. traffic goals** onto the Gantt chart (color-coded), so you can see at a glance which launches are for \$\$\$ vs. for eyeballs?
