# Line Filter Tool - Overview

## Purpose
A high-performance web-based tool for filtering, searching, and analyzing large text files including logs, CSV files, JSON lines, and other structured or unstructured text data.

## Target Users
- **DevOps Engineers**: Analyzing production logs, error tracking, performance monitoring
- **Data Analysts**: Cleaning CSV exports, filtering datasets, data validation
- **Developers**: Debugging application logs, monitoring real-time output
- **System Administrators**: Reviewing system logs, security audits, access logs
- **QA Engineers**: Test result analysis, error report filtering

## Core Value Proposition
- Handle files from 1KB to 1GB+ without freezing the browser
- Real-time filtering with instant feedback
- No server required - fully client-side processing
- Smart pattern matching with text, regex, and glob support
- Export filtered results in multiple formats

## Key Use Cases

### 1. Production Log Analysis
- Filter 500MB nginx logs for specific error codes
- Find all requests from particular IP ranges
- Identify patterns in error messages
- Extract time-based anomalies

### 2. CSV Data Cleaning
- Remove test data from customer exports
- Filter out invalid email addresses
- Select rows matching specific criteria
- Validate data before import

### 3. Real-time Monitoring
- Watch log files for specific patterns
- Highlight critical errors as they appear
- Filter noise from verbose output
- Track specific user sessions

### 4. Security Auditing
- Search access logs for suspicious patterns
- Filter authentication failures
- Track privilege escalations
- Identify unusual access patterns

### 5. Application Debugging
- Filter stack traces by exception type
- Find all logs for specific user ID
- Isolate time windows of interest
- Compare error patterns across deployments

## Key Features

### Data Input
- Drag & drop file upload (max 10,000 lines or 5MB)
- Paste text directly 
- No server processing - fully client-side

### Filtering Capabilities
- Multiple include/exclude filters with clear AND logic
