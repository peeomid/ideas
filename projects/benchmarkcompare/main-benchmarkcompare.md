# BenchmarkCompare - Computer Specs & Benchmark Comparison

## Problem Statement

When shopping for computers (laptops, desktops, phones), comparing specifications and real-world performance is frustratingly difficult:
- Need to open multiple tabs to compare different models
- Benchmark scores scattered across different sites (Geekbench, Cinebench, PassMark, etc.)
- No unified view of specs vs. real-world performance
- Hard to filter by budget, use case, or specific requirements
- Technical specs don't translate well to practical performance understanding

## Solution Overview

A clean, side-by-side comparison tool that aggregates:
- **Technical Specifications**: CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, display, etc.
- **Benchmark Scores**: Multi-platform benchmark aggregation
- **Real-world Performance**: Gaming FPS, video editing times, battery life
