# Tech Guide Site - Making Technology Simple for Small Businesses

## Problem Statement

Small business owners struggle with technology implementation because:
- Most tech content is too vague or high-level ("use social media for marketing")
- Lack of step-by-step, actionable guides
- Technical jargon makes simple tasks seem complicated
- Generic advice doesn't address specific small business needs
- Time-poor business owners need quick, practical solutions

## Solution Overview

A content site that provides **practical, step-by-step technology guides** specifically for small businesses. Focus on actionable tutorials that small business owners can follow immediately to solve real problems.

**Core Principle**: "Show, don't just tell" - every guide includes screenshots, exact steps, and expected outcomes.

## Target Audience

- Small business owners (1-50 employees)
- Local service businesses (restaurants, salons, repair shops)
- E-commerce entrepreneurs
- Freelancers and consultants
- Business owners who are not tech-savvy but need technology solutions

## Things I target
- Site shouldn't look like a news site, like https://smebusinessreview.com
    -> Should be simple, easy to navigate, not flood with tons of things. Easy to find things specific for industry
