# AutoSenso (MailMinder) - Quick Introduction

AutoSenso is a Gmail automation tool that brings HEY.com's innovative email organization workflow to your existing Gmail account. It automatically sorts emails into categories (Imbox, Feed, Papertrail, Promotional) based on your preferences, keeping your inbox clean and organized without requiring a new email address or subscription service.

The tool works by learning from your manual categorization choices - when you label an email for sorting, it automatically creates Gmail filters to handle future emails from that sender. This eliminates email overload and ensures important messages stay visible while newsletters, receipts, and promotional emails are automatically organized into appropriate categories.

Built as a Google Apps Script that runs entirely within your Google account, AutoSenso offers the privacy and control of HEY.com's system while maintaining compatibility with your existing Gmail setup, mobile apps, and Google Workspace integration.
