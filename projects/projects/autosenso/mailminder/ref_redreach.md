- "BUT... Reddit Marketing Is Hard"
  - To find posts that have high purchase intent and rank on Google, you typically need a suite of tools. SEO tools like Ahrefs alone cost $140/month. Redreach gives you the same insights at a fraction of the cost.
  - It's difficult to identify relevant keywords, and even then, the results are cluttered with irrelevant content. Our AI cuts through this noise, providing posts that are highly relevant to your brand and product.
  - It's notoriously easy to get banned promoting your product. The internet doesn't need more spam, right? We help you craft genuine, thoughtful comments & posts that bring value and don't get you banned.
  - ... and the list goes on.

## FAQ Section
- Headline: "Frequently Asked Questions"
- Subheadline: "Have questions about Redreach? 🤔 We have the answers. If you can't find what you're looking for here, reach out."
- Questions & Answers:  
    - Do I need my own Reddit account to use Redreach?
        - Yes, you need your own Reddit account. We believe in AI-guided responses, not fully automated ones with bought bots. This approach protects your brand image and reputation. While automation might seem appealing, you don't want AI spamming the internet on your behalf, potentially damaging your reputation. Redreach helps you craft thoughtful, genuine responses that align with your brand voice.
    - How can I avoid getting blocked for spam when commenting on subreddits?
        - Redreach prioritizes posts with high search intent, where people are already looking for recommendations. As a rule of thumb we suggest you to not use direct links in your replies unless everyone else does it. Simply mention your product in a way that feels natural and helpful to the conversation. This is the key to effective Reddit marketing. Our AI helps you create replies that subtly mention your product while providing genuine value to the conversation. We guide you in crafting responses that are natural, helpful, and less likely to be flagged as spam.
    - What does the 3-day pass one-time purchase include?
        - The 3-day pass gives you full access to Redreach Pro features, except for daily mention tracking. You'll receive a comprehensive report of all search-ranking Reddit posts, plus company and competitor mentions up to the current date. It's a great way to experience the power of Redreach and gather valuable insights without committing to a subscription just yet.
    -   Does my company need a website to use Redreach?
        - Yes, we currently require information about your website to provide the best results. If you're working on a new idea and want to validate it without a website, please contact us, and we'll help you find a way to use our service effectively.
    - How long does the process take from setup to receiving post recommendations?
        - After onboarding, which takes less than two minutes, our AI analyzes hundreds of data points. The entire process typically takes around 2-3 minutes. You'll be notified via email once your post recommendations are ready to access.
    - What makes Redreach different from other Reddit marketing tools?
        - We believe solely relying on manually added keywords is inherently flawed. Redreach uses advanced AI to determine relevant keywords and find high purchase intent posts without you needing to come up with keywords. Our 'magic' algorithm analyzes your website and competitors to identify the most relevant opportunities, saving you time and getting you relevant leads.
    - Can Redreach guarantee results or increased sales?
        - While we can't guarantee specific results or sales increases, Redreach significantly improves your chances of success on Reddit by identifying high-impact conversations and guiding you to engage effectively. Your success will depend on factors like your product, your engagement style, and your target audience's receptiveness.
    - Do you offer a money-back guarantee?
        - Yes, we absolutely believe in the power of our tool and want you to get the best out of it. Redreach pays for itself if you get a single new customer. Amazing right? However, should you not be satisfied with the results, we happily offer a money-back guarantee within the first 48 hours after payment.
