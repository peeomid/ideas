    - update secure -> It relies on no external services, nothing is sent outside your account.
    - Interface -> use existing Gmail interface -> works on both web and mobile app.
- In How Mail Minder works:
    - MailMinder is a Google App script, that runs on a Google Sheet file -> this works too identical to features, so need to rephrase it to make it non-tech friendly.
- Update CTA to something better. Start organizing your gmail feels like you have to so it yourself. Pick a better CTA, that highlights the value that MailMinder will do it for you.

Further updates:

Additional feedback:
- Features that make the difference:
    - You can use your existing gmail account/Google Workspace account, no need to leave it.
- Pricing:
    - Transfer money value to time value and other values, instead of just saying the number, which makes price less scary. Also makes it clearer, when you pay for this, you can use it for life time -> translate it to lower price. You can compare to subscription services like hey.com as well, which cost $99/year.
    Also, for custom domain, it's even more expensive on hey.com, min $120/year. Plus, you'll have to leave existing Google Workspace account.
    - Add a bit of scarcity, by saying this is a limited time offer, or this is a beta version. Price will increase after beta. Save up to 40% now.

More feedback on pricing:
    - Time save should be 30 minutes per day, not 1 hour.
    - Translate that to value, given some value per hour, how much time till break even?
    - Compare, hey.com is $99/year, EACH year. MailMinder is a one-time payment of $29.99. You pay once, and you it for life.

More on pricing:
    - "At $30/hour, that's $15 saved per day" -> make it, so people with higher hourly rate can see the value. Like even at this low rate, you already save so much. So for your higher rate, the savings are even greater.
