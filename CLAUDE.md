# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an Obsidian vault containing personal idea notes, project concepts, and planning documents. The repository consists primarily of markdown files documenting various business ideas, project proposals, and development concepts.

## File Structure

- `ideas.md` - Main collection of project ideas organized by priority (Working on, Ideas considering, Low priority, Done)
- `building_guide.md` - Resources for building micro-SaaS products
- `1_financial_forecast.md` - Financial planning and forecasting content
- `traffic-growth-report.md` - Analysis or reporting on traffic growth
- `*.canvas` files - Obsidian canvas files for visual mind mapping
- Daily notes (e.g., `2025-08-19.md`) - Time-based documentation

## Content Categories

The ideas span various domains:
- Development tools and utilities (regex tools, diff viewers, code formatters)
- Business applications (QR code generators, menu systems, review tools)
- Web scraping and data aggregation projects
- Financial planning and analysis tools
- Mobile and desktop applications

## Working with This Repository

This is a documentation and planning repository rather than a codebase. When working with these files:

1. **Markdown Editing**: All content files use standard markdown format
2. **Idea Organization**: Ideas are categorized by implementation priority and status
3. **Obsidian Integration**: Files are designed to work within the Obsidian knowledge management system
4. **No Build Process**: This repository contains documentation only - no compilation or build steps required

## Common Tasks

- **Adding New Ideas**: Append to appropriate sections in `ideas.md`
- **Updating Project Status**: Move ideas between priority categories
- **Creating Detailed Plans**: Create separate markdown files for complex project specifications
- **Daily Documentation**: Use date-based filenames for daily notes and progress tracking
