## Ideas considering

0. Devsgen: Common dev utils things -> Web version first to verify, before actually have an app
    This is to solve common tasks I do, like regular regex replacement
    Find and replace in bulk, that is not just 1, but a list of replaces
    Beautify code without validating
    -> Library of common regex patterns

    Json viewer with filter support

Search over a list of lines: for example I have a logs file, I want to filter out/in certain patterns

Better diff compare using AST with difftastic

9. Tool convert định dạng 2 file excel
    - File exported from one app to be imported to another -> need to convert 

15. Group games
trochoinhom.com
Allow people to play group games online
LIke "Ai là gián điệp" - "Who is the spy?"

4. Restore qr payment generator
    - Generate QR code for payment
    - Allow group storing of QR codes -> Easy share of QR code/Accounts

16. Mua quà gì?

17. Get updates then post?
Idea is to get updates from website people rarely check, then post to facebook?

3. Tool to remind me on things:
- For example I got this list of util tools: https://x.com/ChShersh/status/1956014178486870097 
I've installed them, but to actually use them, I need periodic reminder
    
3. There’s a solution for that
    Site for people to search for app/solution for their problem

6. Free menu for restaurant generation
    - Generate menu for restaurant
    - Generate QR code for menu

    -> Programmatic idea: Take menu from Google Profile -> Create site to shoe Menu online for restaurants


8. QR for Business
    - Generate QR code for business
    - Generate QR with information for business -> can customize with business info theme
    - Analytics? -> Pixel for tracking for ads

10. Xehoi.top -> better version
    - Crawl car listing sites for information on car price
    - Crawl car model information/specs
    - Tool to compare car price with given requirements
    - List youtube video for car review
    - List of issues/recalls
    - Part/service costs
    - Maintenance schedule/cost
    - Show safety rating, actual model -> eg Yaris Cross in VN has no rating
    - A better UI for ncap rating, all ncap rating site UI are horrible

    - Chi phí nuôi xe

giaxehoi.vn -> very little traffic
    
11. Github repo listing for different categories
    - Problem: it's very difficult to find repo for a specific problem
    - Solution: 
        Group repo based on category -> search using text/natural language

12. Tool to generate link/qr to go to Google Reviews
    So business can quickly ask their customers to leave reviews quickly

13. How often should I change sth
There're a lot of stuff in my house I need to maintain/change in regular basis, like car oil, water filter, etc
I want an app that allow me to:
- Add my thing, it can be from already defined list, or custom
- If things are from list, it'll show suggestion predefined, like for car, what are things to maintain, how often it should be change, like after 6 month, or 10k km (can be mixed multiple units), or I can do custom, with min and max time.
- Then it'll alert/notify me when it's time to change
It can give me links to buy replacement, or maintenance service

14. Turn a google docs into readable page, with tracking/pixel

7. Shopify app listing
    - Problem: it's difficult for app developer to find app ideas, check existing shopify app with bad review to get app ideas
    - Solution:
        A listing site with filter/search on app stats, reviews, etc

18. Mac app to manage work session

19. Alert -> Pay CC

## Low priority

1. Flowcast: Financial forcast/what-if analysis tool
    I can input in income, expense, and see the forecast
    Can put in multiple types:
        - Saving
        - Income: Salary, etc
        - Expense: Rent, etc
            - Investment: Stock
            - Debt: Loan, etc -> car loan, can set interest rate, and other details
            - Storage: Bank account, etc -> can set interest rate
        Each type has its own set of details I can put in, like depreciation rate, appreciation rate, etc
            Or can have dynamic interest rate, like for car payment, there're multiple types of car loan, and each has its own interest rate: for example, first year with 5%, then from 2nd year, 10%, on remaining money
        Each type has its own set of risk level, like investment, 

        Then I can do what-if analysis to compare cases, for example, if I do A, B vs C and D

## Done

5. Paste in text -> Make it readable -> easytoread.top
    Normally, there're text like facebook post, or a text message, or website text, that are long, and difficult to read. This tool will make it readable

## For my own use

vs renting vs buying
