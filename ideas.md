## Strategies
- For traffic sites? -> Need to deploy early MVP and see how Google picks up?
    - When it ranks, will see other keywords people are actually searching for -> this will give ideas on more tools/content
- Need to test other channels, other than just SEO, eg Youtube, Tiktok, etc
- Will probably build several things, then go into marketing mode while continuing to build small stuff
- Should try to build things:
    - Use by myself?
    - For Sahaja? Sahaja needs more marketing, not building? Admin for form dang ky
