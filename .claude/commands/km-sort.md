Perform comprehensive knowledge management sorting:

## 1. Knowledge Reminder (Random Review)
- Pick 1-2 random articles from `knowledge/articles/` or topics from `knowledge/topics/`
- Show brief summary of what I learned previously
- Ask if I want to explore related topics or add new insights

## 2. Stale Link Check
- Review `knowledge/01-reading-queue.md` for articles with dates
- Identify and highlight links added >2 weeks ago that haven't been read
- Show these "stale" articles with reasons why they might still be relevant

## 3. Weekly Curation
- Review `knowledge/01-reading-queue.md` 
- Select 3-5 articles based on:
  - Current projects from `ideas.md`
  - Topics I'm working on
  - Mix of recent and older articles (prioritize stale ones)
- Move selected articles to `knowledge/00-inbox.md` under "Curated Articles"
- Add reading tasks to `todo.md`

## 4. Summary Report
Present:
- Random knowledge reminder
- Stale articles found
- This week's curated reading list
- Reading tasks added to todo

Help me maintain active knowledge circulation and focused weekly reading.
