# Repository Guidelines

This repository uses CLAUDE.md as the single source of truth for project structure, conventions, and workflows. This file intentionally stays minimal and defers to that document.

## Primary Guide
- Read: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)
- Covers: vault overview, naming patterns, project templates, todo workflow, and editing practices.

## Quick Start
- Browse ideas: open `ideas.md` and follow links to projects.
- Create a project: `projects/<name>/main-<name>.md` + `projects/<name>/todo.md`.
- Keep links Obsidian-friendly (wiki links) as demonstrated in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Conventions (See CLAUDE.md for details)
- Filenames: kebab-case; main files as `main-<project>.md`; task lists as `todo.md`.
- Organization: each project lives in `projects/<name>/` with supporting docs inside.
- Editing: standard Markdown; no build or tooling required.

## Contributions
- Follow the structure and workflow described in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Commit messages: short, imperative, and scoped to the changed area (e.g., `Update projects/textua specs`).

If guidance appears to conflict, prioritize the instructions and examples in `CLAUDE.md`.
